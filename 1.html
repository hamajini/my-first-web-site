  <h1>Ukraine war: Zelensky calls for 'just punishment' for Russia</h1>
  <p><strong>Russia must face "just punishment" over its invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has told the UN General Assembly in New York.</strong>
  <br>In a pre-recorded video, the Ukrainian leader called for the creation of a special war tribunal and detailed alleged war crimes by Russia.
  <br>He also set out a peace "formula", including more military support and to punish Russia on the world stage.
  <br>His address received a standing ovation from many of the session's attendees.
  <br>In his introductory remarks, Mr Zelensky accused Russia of causing "catastrophic turbulence" with its "illegal war".</p>

  style="margin-top:20px;">He spoke on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin called up 300,000 military reservists for duty, a move which prompted rare protests on the streets of Russia.
  <br>Mr Zelensky said the move showed his enemy was not serious about peace talks.
  <br>He condemned recently-announced plans in Russian-occupied areas of his country to hold so-called referendums on joining Russia - a plan denounced by Western leaders at the UN on Tuesday.</p>
